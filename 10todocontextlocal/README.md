### Local Storage
- localstorage associated with the browser, not with the framework (react etc). Browser has its local storage, which is used by diff frameworks, libraries etc.
- values in local storage are always stored in string format
- we can access localstorage directly till we are only working on react ( and does not talk about server side rendering (backend), because then all work will happen on server side, and data will never go in localstorage)
